- Source an adjustable constant current varying from 0 to 1000 mA
- Sink an adjustable constant current varying from 0 to 1000 mA
- Set a timer for sourcing or sinking the set current
- Calculate the capacity when sinking a current from a connected load
- Automatically switch off if no current is flowing

The software is written in JAL, running on a PIC Microcontroller.
